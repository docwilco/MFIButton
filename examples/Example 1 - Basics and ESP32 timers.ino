    // First off, examples of functions which are defined elsewhere.
    // For the various sequences, _only_ the callback that matches the user's
    // input will be called. For example, if the user clicks the button twice
    // quickly, only the double click callback will be called.
    button1.onClick(button1_click_callback);

    // onClick and onDoubleClick are just easy to use versions of onSequence().

    // time. The first argument is the number of milliseconds to wait before
    // triggering.
    //
    // Since long presses are hard for users to time, the default is for
    // something to happen after the timeout has passed and the button is still
    // pressed, even if the button is being held for longer. That way the user
    // can judge when the desired duration has been reached.

    // For those who want a little more low-level input (possibly for debugging)
    // you can use the following two event handlers. They are called when the
    // button is pressed and released, respectively. So for a double click, you
    // will get press, release, press, and release events. Generally, these are
    // not needed.
    //
    // Serial comms are not recommended in these callbacks, as they are called
    // from an interrupt context, but if you keep them really short, you can
    // get away with it for debugging.

    // Step 3: Setup the timer code. This example is ESP32 specific, see the
    // documentation for what is needed to use this library on other platforms.
    //
    // Timers are scarce on Arduino, hence leaving this to the user so they can
    // easily integrate this library into code that already uses timers.
    //
    // This setup only has to be done once, no matter the number of buttons
    // you're using with this library.

    // Start a timer 0 (of 4) with a divider of 80, counting up. This will turn
    // the 80MHz timer into a 1 microsecond timer. If your ESP32 has a different
    // clock speed, you'll need to adjust the divider accordingly.
    timer = timerBegin(0, 80, true);
    // When the timer goes off, the MFIButton::timerInterruptHandler() function
    // needs to be called. It will then call the appropriate callbacks for each
    // button. The third argument here is ignored by the ESP-arduino library for
    // now.
    timerAttachInterrupt(timer, MFIButton::timerInterruptHandler, true);
    // And this is how we tell the library to set a timer. The only argument is
    // the duration until the interrupt should fire. The library expects this to
    // be in microseconds.
    MFIButton::setInterruptTimerCallback([](uint16_t duration) {
        // Read the timer's current value. This is the number of microseconds
        // since the timer started counting. This is better than resetting the
        // timer, since that seems to sporadically not work when it is done
        // from inside a timer interrupt.
        uint64_t timer_value = timerRead(timer);
        // Convert the duration to microseconds and add to current value.
        uint64_t next_timer = (1000 * (uint64_t)duration) + timer_value;
        // Set the timer to fire at the calculated value. The third argument
        // tells the timer to fire only once, not repeatedly.
        timerAlarmWrite(timer, next_timer, false);
        // And enable the interrupt firing. We might be able to get away with
        // only doing this once, but enabling it without setting a value seems
        // undefined behavior. And this doesn't hurt anything if it's done
        // multiple times.
        timerAlarmEnable(timer);

    // Here ends the ESP32 specific code.

    // Step 4: Finally start the buttons. This will attempt to bind the pins to
